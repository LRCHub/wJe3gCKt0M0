```lrc
[00:00.92] I once wished to disappear
[00:08.85] When the stares were burning me
[00:16.69] I thought if I'd abandoned this flesh, lived as consciousness
[00:26.38] I might be beautiful too
[00:32.85] Clearly know in this vast cosmo
[00:40.44] I'm just a small mayfly
[00:47.52] Oh, in the wake of a nova's light
[00:56.73] I felt invincible like I could reach to the sky
[01:06.78] Starlight travels years and then finds its way to you
[01:15.96] Will my heartbeat ever reach you too?
[01:23.94] Just one look from you
[01:28.15] Threw me in a quantum leap (Threw me in a quantum leap)
[01:34.16] Blurred all that was and will be
[01:50.16] 
[02:12.84] At the thought of your existence
[02:20.44] My heart finds certainty
[02:27.42] While it's the fantasies of seeing you once more
[02:36.84] Navigate my steps through countless starless nights
[02:46.97] After all this time, I've found my way to the light
[02:55.95] Am I now worthy to stand by your side?
[03:04.00] If I disappear with our vow in solar flare (Our vow in solar flare)
[03:14.07] See the future for me please
[03:28.07] 
[03:39.98] If someday you wander
[03:43.49] Through seasons I could never share
[03:47.47] Forget me not
[03:56.81] Maybe I will also become somebody's light
